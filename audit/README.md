# Aion Token Contract Audit

## Summary

[Nuco](https://nuco.io/) is developing a token contract for it's [Aion network](https://aion.network/).

Bok Consulting Pty Ltd was commissioned to perform an audit on the Ethereum smart contracts for Nuco's Aion token.

This audit has been conducted on Nuco's source code in commit
[4c2dcc9](https://github.com/gonuco/aion.erc.contract/commit/4c2dcc92b4ba404211deb3bf0559eaa8d43b2e84),
[17cfee9](https://github.com/gonuco/aion.erc.contract/commit/17cfee99792ba31f63e541445e8d6878a169e9c8) and
[09632c2](https://github.com/gonuco/aion.erc.contract/commit/09632c24a322daa37c112c1d6349faa10888cc45).

## Recommendations

* **LOW IMPORTANCE** Consider whether the code to check for the [Short Address Attack](https://blog.coinfabrik.com/smart-contract-short-address-attack-mitigation-failure/)
  is required. Here's [OpenZeppelin's Short Address Attack removal](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/commit/e33d9bb41be136f12bc734aef1aa6fffbf54fa40)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** As stated in your main [README.md](../README.md), your target Solidity version is 0.4.15 . Consider updating your Solidity
  files to `pragma solidity >=0.4.15;` for people only reading your published source code (.e.g. from EtherScan.io)
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** Consider making `Owned.newOwner` public and for the `acceptOwnership(...)` function to emit an event.
  See [example](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/GimliTokenContractAudit/blob/master/sol/Ownable.sol#L6-L32). It would also be good to add
  `newOwner = 0x0;` after a successful change in ownership. This will help improve the process and traceability of the ownership changes.
  The same applies to the dispersed *Owned* code in *sales/Receiver*, *sales/Sale* and *trs/Savings*
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** Consider renaming `Pausable.unpause()` to `Pausable.unPause()`
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** Consider emitting an event log in `TokenReceivable.claimTokens(...)`
* **LOW IMPORTANCE** The *token/Owned* functionality is mixed into *sales/Receiver*, *sales/Sale* and *trs/Savings*.
  Consider inheriting from *token/Owned* to simplify the code and separating functionality instead of reimplementing
  the functionality in each of *sales/Receiver*, *sales/Sale* and *trs/Savings*
